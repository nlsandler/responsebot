A program for training sequence-to-sequence LSTMs in Keras

This program is based on 
[A ten-minute introduction to sequence-to-sequence learning in Keras](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html),
but uses a word-level model with an embedding layer, rather than a character-level model.


## Usage
`example_usage.py` demonstrates how you can use the program.


## Requirements
* keras
* tensorflow (should work with other backends too, but I haven't tested it)
